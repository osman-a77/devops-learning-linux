# devops-learning-linux
Here I will be documenting my solutions to the OverTheWire Bandit Game as well as explanations and key lessons. 
The main objective from completing this is to solidify my linux knowledge.


## Level 0 → Level 1
**Solution**
cat readme

**Explanation**
This is quite straight forward. The cat command shows contents of file which contains password.

**Password** ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If



## Level 1 → Level 2
**Solution**
cat ./-

**Explanation**
The password is stored in a file who's name is - and is located in the home directory so you cannot simply just do cat -.

**Password** 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to read files whose name is a special character. 
Also not naming a file a special character will make it easier to read.



## Level 2 → Level 3
**Solution**
cat ./"--spaces in this filename--"

**Explanation**
Since the file name has spaces it must be enclosed with speech marks in the argument.

*Password** MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to read files whose names has spaces.



## Level 3 → Level 4
**Solution**
cd inhere 
ls -a
cat ...Hiding-From-You

**Explanation** 
The password is in a hidden file in the directory called inhere. Therefor first you must change directory to inhere then use the ls -a
command to see hidden files. Finally use cat command to read hidden file.

**Password** 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to list hidden files.



## Level 4 → Lesson 5
**Solution**
cd inhere
ls
file ./-file07
cat ./-file07

**Explanation**
First you must change to the inhere directory. Then by using the ls command you get a list files in which one of them has the password.
By using the the file command you can identify which is the only human-readable file since it'll display ASCII text. Then use the cat 
command to read the correct file.

**Password** 4oQYVPkxZOOEOO5pTW81FB8j8lxXGUQw

**Lesson**
Here you learn that the file command can be used to identify which file is human-readable.



## Level 5 → Level 6
**Solution**
cd inhere
find . -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
cat maybehere07/.file2

**Explanation**
Here we're looking for a file with specific properties. First you change directory to inhere. Then you'll realize that there are too many 
directories and files to check. So instead of looking at each at a time you can use a command that will search through everything to find
exactly what you're looking for. Once desired file is displayed use cat command to read and find password.

**Password** HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

**Lesson**
Here you learn that by using the find command you can display the exact file with desired properties.



## Level 6 → Level 7
**Solution**
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

**Explanation**
Here we're told that the password is somewhere on the server so you must use commanad find /. This will start search from the root 
directory. Then the password will be located in the location that doesn't deny permission. Then use cat command to read it.

**Password** morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to use find command to search entire server from the root directory.



## Level 7 → Level 8
**Solution**
vim data.txt
/millionth

**EXplanation**
Here we're told that the password is located next to the word millionth in the file data.txt, however, this file is massive. Using cat 
command would be impossible. So instead using vim command and then in command mode typing /millionth will send you right to where the word
millionth is.

**Password** dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc

**Lesson**
Here you learn that at times using vim is better than cat especially for large files and for locating specific words.



## Level 8 → Level 9
**Solution**
sort data.txt | uniq -u

**Explanation**
Here we are asked to look for passwword in data.txt and that it is the only line of text that appears once. Since file is too big you 
can use the sort and uniq commands to find desired line of text.

**Password** 4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM

**Lesson**
Here you learn that using both sort nd uniq command can help find desired line of text.



## Level 9 → Level 10
**Solution**
vim data.txt
/==
repeat n until find solution

**Explanation**
Password is located in the data.txt file proceeded by many '=' characters. First by using vim command and then while in command mode 
typing /== will locate where in data.txt "==" characters are present. Afterward keep pressing n to search each location where "==" 
characters are located until you find the password.

**Password** FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey

**Lesson**
Here you learn how pressing n can allow you to locate desired line of text.



## Level 10 → Level 11
**Solution**
base64 -d data.txt

**Explanation**
Here we're told that the password is located in data.txt but it's base64 coded. So in order to decode it you must use command base64 -d
which will then display password.

**Password** dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to decode base64 coded data into string of printable ASCII characters.



## Level 11 → Level 12
**Solution**
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

**Explanation**
Here the password is located within data.txt but its characters have been rotated 13 positions for both lowercase and uppercase. The tr 
command can transform the string back to its original order.

**Password** 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to use the tr command to transform a string.



## Level 12 → Level 13
**Solution** (the comma is to separate each command line)
mkdir /tmp/Hello ,  cp data.txt /tmp/Hello ,  cd /tmp/Hello ,  xxd -r data.txt > data ,  file data ,  mv data file.gz ,  gzip -d file.gz ,
file file ,  mv file file.bz2 ,  bzip2 -d file.bz2 ,  file file ,  mv file file.gz , gzip -d file.gz ,  file file ,  mv file file.tar , 
tar xf file.tar ,  file data5.bin ,  mv data5.bin data.tar ,  tar xf data.tar ,  file data6.bin ,  mv data6.bin data.bz2 ,
bzip -d data.bz2 ,  file data ,  mv data data.tar ,  tar xf data.tar ,  file data8.bin ,  mv data8.bin data.gz ,  gzip -d data.gz ,
file data ,  cat data

**Explanation**
Here the password is located in a hexdump file that has been repeatedly compressed. First you must create directory and move data.txt 
there. Then you must use xxd command to reverse hexdump. Then you must repeatedly use the file command to identify file type then use 
correct commands to decompress the file each time. Important commands are tar xf and gzip -d and bzip2 -d. When the file type is 
ASCII text then use cat command to read that file and get the password.

**Password** 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

**Lesson**
Here you learn what are hexdumps and to reverse it. Also you learn how to decompress compressed files by using appropriate commands
each time.



## Level 13 → Level 14
**Solution**
cat sshkey.private 
then copy contents to private.key
exit
ls -la
chmod 700 private.key
ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -i private.key
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

**Explanation**
Here the password is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14, however, this can only be read by bandit14. First step is to use cat command to read contents of sshkey.private and then copy
and paste on to a new file called private.key. Then exit server. Next you make sure that private.key is executable by using the chmod command. Then you log into bandit14 with the
identity file private.key. Then the password is found by reading contents of /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14.

**Password** MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

**Lesson**
Here you learn how to log into a new server using ssh private key and always making sure to check whether a file is executable or not.



## Level 14 → Level 15
**Solution**
nc localhost 30000
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo

**Explanation**
Here in order to find the password you must submit previous password to port 30000 on localhost. The nc command can send data to different hosts, therefore, you can then use it to 
connect to the specified port and paste the previous password which will then output password for the current level.

**Password** 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo

**Lesson**
Here you learn that you can use the nc command to send data to a different host.



# Level 15 → Level 16
**Solution**
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo

**Explanation**
Here the password can be obtained by submitting the previous password to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption. This is done by using the commands openssl and s_client.
This will send data using SSL encryption. Final you paste the previous password and then the output will be the password you're looking for.

**Password** kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

**Lesson**
Here you learn that you can send data using SSL encryption by using the commands openssl and s_client.



# Level 16 → Level 17
**Solution**
